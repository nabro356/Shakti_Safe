# Shakti_Safe

A web application embedded with Google maps API which shows the safest route to travel based on safety index derived from crime rate.

<h2>Technologies used :</h2>
<p>1. Node.js and Express.js - server side development</p>
<p>2. Google Maps API- for directions application</p>
<p><b>K-means Clustering Algorithm</b></p>
<p>The safest route is the route which has the least danger index. Crime rate statistics are K-means(k=5) clustered to get 5 clusters ranging from unsafe to safe. Areas are assigned an index according their respective cluster. The Google Maps is coded to show the path passing through safe index areas. </p>

<p>Note : Embedded in Shakti-SOS App</p>
